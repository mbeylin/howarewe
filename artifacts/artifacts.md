**NFT Metadata**: `{"name":"HOW ARE WE","description":"HOW ARE WE is a project by Emily Mast and Yehuda Duenyas, featuring works by Barnett Cohen, Constance Hockaday & Faye Driscoll, Darrian O’Reilly, David Adrian Freeland Jr., Dorothy Dubrule, Emily Mast & Yehuda Duenyas, Hana van der Kolk, Heyward Bracey, Jay Carlon, Jessica Emmanuel, Jennie MaryTai Liu, Mireya Lucio, Shannon Hafez, Stacy Dawson Stearns, and Terrence Luke Johnson. HOW ARE WE is a collectively-created performance consisting of fifteen 90-second solos made in quarantined isolation during the first wave of Covid-19 in May of 2020. In the week prior to LA's scheduled reopening date, artists made work that responded to 10 prompts proposed by Emily Mast and Yehuda Duenyas. HOW ARE WE is an artifact that at once captures a now seemingly distant moment in time and also engages with a wider set of questions cracked open by the conditions of the pandemic. The final work was uploaded onto the blockchain as an immutable digital “artifact.” Artists, writers, programmers and a lawyer co-own the work through a “smart contract” ensuring transparent and equal distribution of wealth, thus upending traditional notions of the art market and exchange. HOW ARE WE asks how artistic imagination can come together with technological innovation to reimagine the world at a time when value, equality and humanity are demanding radical reconsideration. HOW ARE WE was commissioned as part of the ENTER program by the Onassis Foundation.","external_url":"https://howarewe.xyz","image":"ipfs://ipfs/QmVyjHJzFii3NznqTHeUQvbNrkcYeXp88RXRHcorZZUK1S/HOWAREWE_logo_June_25_2020.jpeg","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Video Hash","value":"QmaR59SvNKAMWYqcRb9eV18d6yZmKWo2jFRqfrsjJ6ghbq"}]}`
